Literature Review
========================================================


- I conducted a literature review for a project for the National Parks Service 
- The subject of hurricane impacts and change analysis studies 
that could be applied to Gateway National Recreation Area, Assateague and Fire 
Island National Seashores. 
- Focused on the methodologies of each study, and did not analyze 
the results

Search Tools
========================================================

* I started with http://uri.libguides.com/life
* This is the life sciences staging page
* List of many useful databases that URI has subscriptions too
* Conspicuous absences are Bioone and Google Scholar

Useful Databases
=======
![alt text](/presentation/logos.png)
* All easy to search have an account system to save searches
* Many smaller databases may be useful for particular topics
* Read the abstracts!
* Google Scholar very good at locating specific articles and determing URI's access to that article.
